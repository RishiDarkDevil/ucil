//! The LSP diagnostics bridge skeleton (`P1-W5-F03`, `WO-0014`).
//!
//! Per master-plan §13.3, UCIL owns a thin bridge that either delegates
//! LSP responsibilities to a Serena plugin (when Serena is registered
//! and ACTIVE) or spawns its own language servers (degraded mode).  This
//! module introduces the [`LspDiagnosticsBridge`] struct and its
//! accessor surface.
//!
//! At `P1-W5-F03` the bridge carries only a single boolean
//! (`serena_managed`) plus two empty maps — the endpoint map is
//! populated by `P1-W5-F07`, the diagnostics cache by `P1-W5-F04`.
//! Per `DEC-0008` the bridge takes a plain `bool` rather than a
//! reference to `ucil-daemon`'s `PluginManager` so that
//! `ucil-lsp-diagnostics` stays cycle-free.  The daemon integration
//! (reading `PluginManager::registered_runtimes()` and passing the
//! resulting bool) is reserved for a future progressive-startup WO.

// `BridgeError` deliberately repeats the `bridge` module name — the
// convention in this workspace is `<module>Error` (see
// `KnowledgeGraphError` in `ucil-core::knowledge_graph`).  Allowing
// the lint at module scope keeps the naming consistent without
// per-item `#[allow]` spam.
